## About me

<div class="left">

<p>Hello there! I'm a bioinformatics grad student who loves algorithms. At UC
Santa Cruz, I hope to explore methods to detect and genotype structural
variation. Structural variants are often much more potent than easy-to-genotype
variants, e.g. single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs. Yet, standard genetic
analyses use SNPs because of how easily, cheaply, and accurately they can be
genotyped at scale. I want to change that. I want to make using structural
variants common practice. I believe we're on the brink of a genomics revolution
and I want to be a part of it.</p>

<p>We can't use what we can't see. There's a classic story of a person looking
for their keys under a street-lamp because the light is brightest. In this case,
we're looking for genetic signals in SNPs because they're the easiest to see. My
goal is to turn on the sun.</p>
