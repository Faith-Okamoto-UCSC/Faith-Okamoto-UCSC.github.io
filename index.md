## About me

Hello there! I'm a bioinformatics grad student fascinated by the beauty of algorithms. At UC Santa Cruz, I'm excited to explore methods to detect and genotype structural variation.  Structural variants are often much more potent than easy-to-genotype variants, e.g. single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs. Yet, standard genetic analyses use SNPs because of how easily, cheaply, and accurately they can be genotyped at scale. I want to change that. I want to make using structural variants common practice. I believe we're on the brink of a genomics revolution and I want to be a part of it.

We can't use what we can't see. There's a classic story of a person looking for their keys under a street-lamp because the light is brightest. In this case, we're looking for genetic signals in SNPs because they're the easiest to see. My goal is to turn on the sun.
